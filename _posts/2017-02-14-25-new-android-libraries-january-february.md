Even if the list is put in order, I don’t prioritise any of the items. Let’s
start!

1.  [Lottie](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android)  
    This is a library that parses [Adobe After Effects](http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects.html)
    animations exported as JSON with [Bodymovin](https://github.com/bodymovin/bodymovin) (After Effects plugin for
    exporting animations to svg/canvas/html + JS) and renders them natively on
    mobile.   
    There is also an example app available in the [Google Play
    Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.airbnb.lottie).   
    More than 7.5k Github users who starred this library can not be wrong!

2. [Toasty](https://github.com/GrenderG/Toasty)  
    This is a library for creating customised `Toasts`. As the author described the lib, it is:

    > The usual Toast, but with steroids.

    You can find screenshots and the link to the library below.

3. [StyleableToast](https://github.com/Muddz/StyleableToast)   
    This is another library for `Toasts` customisation. It adds

    > variety of styling options that gives your app and user experience that little
    > extra unique feeling! Style your toast either by code or in styles.xml!

4. [Store](https://github.com/NYTimes/Store)  
    Store is a library for Async Data Loading and Caching. According to the documentation:

    > Store is a class that simplifies fetching, parsing, storage, and retrieval of
    > data in your application. A Store is similar to the [Repository
    pattern](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649690.aspx) while exposing
    a Reactive API built with RxJava that adheres to a unidirectional data flow.

    The documentation is really comprehensive and the lib is for sure worth trying.
    You can check many flows such as data requests, caching, parsing etc.

5. [PreviewSeekBar](https://github.com/rubensousa/PreviewSeekBar)    
    If you use Google Play Movies, you have probably noticed this great animated  with a
    preview of the movie. It turned out that [Rúben Sousa](https://medium.com/@rubensousa) implemented that as an open-source
    library. The gif below gives a good flavour of its functionalities. If your app
    is for instance a movie player, you should definitely try it!

6. [Chuck](https://github.com/jgilfelt/chuck)  
    If you use [OkHttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/), this is the library that helps
    intercept and persist all HTTP requests and responses inside your application.
    It also provides a UI for inspecting their content.

7. [CoordinatorTabLayout](https://github.com/hugeterry/CoordinatorTabLayout)  
    CoordinatorTabLayout is a custom composite control that quickly implements the
    combination of `TabLayout` and `CoordinatorLayout`. You can check how it works on the gif below:

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*uHE7zqPMPUvTd9i1EYL7Tw.gif)

8. [boxing](https://github.com/Bilibili/boxing)  
    Boxing is a multimedia selector and by using it you can:

    * do a selection of your images (single/multiple images),
    * preview and crop images.

    It also supports gifs, video selection, image compression and custom UI as shown
    in the screenshot below:

9. [excelPanel](https://github.com/zhouchaoyuan/excelPanel)  
    This is a two-dimensional `RecyclerView`. It can not only load historical data, but also load future
    data.

11. [CameraFragment](https://github.com/florent37/CameraFragment)  
    CameraFragment is an implementation of a  which allows you to easily integrate a camera
    functionality to your app. According to *README*:

12. [AwesomeBar](https://github.com/florent37/AwesomeBar)  
    This is another great implementation from [Florent Champigny](https://medium.com/@florentchampigny).
    It is new approach to a design of a top bar (which we know from `ActionBar`/`Toolbar`  implementation),
    in conjunction with `DrawerLayout` ,inspired by [Gmail Mobile from
    Weekz](https://material.uplabs.com/posts/gmail-mobile-concept).
    You can check, how it works below:

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_f0B7c2NBj8IZWp7POwsSg.gif)

13. [ArcNavigationView](https://github.com/rom4ek/ArcNavigationView)  
    This is an implementation of `NavigationView` from Android Design Support Library which introduces
    curved edges.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wd7BSmOzHfIUM-vm3QUdog.png)

14. [ShimmerRecyclerView](https://github.com/sharish/ShimmerRecyclerView)  
    It is a custom `RecyclerView` implementation with shimmer views to indicate that views are
    loading. The `RecyclerView` has also a built-in adapter, to control the shimmer appearance.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xdapq2CQF6gz0EB27qI9Wg.gif)

15. [Android-SwitchIcon](https://github.com/zagum/Android-SwitchIcon)  

    > Google launcher-style implementation of switch (enable/disable) icon.

    This library extends `AppCompatImageView` and allows you to set any icon (vector or image), to `SwitchIconView`
    using `app:srcCompat` attribute.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4bG5o6kN9UZxhIrWmlDJ7A.gif)

16. [CounterFab](https://github.com/andremion/CounterFab)  
    The library is a subclass that shows a counter badge on right top corner. You can download a
    [demo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.andremion.counterfab.sample)
    from Google Play.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*c1H8N1YmunHBQGqK9Ula0Q.gif)

17. [FadingTextView](https://github.com/rosenpin/FadingTextView)  
    This library allows you to make a `TextView` change its content automatically every few seconds.

18. [Bridge](https://github.com/afollestad/bridge)  

    > Bridge is a simple but powerful HTTP networking library for Android. It features
    > a Fluent chainable API, powered by Java/Android’s  classes for maximum
    compatibility and speed.

    This library has a really comprehensive documentation and is definitely worth
    checking.

19. [Ason](https://github.com/afollestad/ason)  
    It is the second library from [Aidan Follestad](https://twitter.com/afollestad).
    Its main idea is to simplify an interaction with JSON. The library

    > also makes (de)serialization painless.

    The documentation is also pretty good, you can check it [here](https://github.com/afollestad/ason).

20. [ObjectBox](https://github.com/greenrobot/ObjectBox)  
    I assume that majority of you knows [greenrobot](http://greenrobot.org/).
    If not, they developed [GreenDAO](https://github.com/greenrobot/greenDAO) and
    [EventBus](https://github.com/greenrobot/EventBus). Now, this is time for a new
    database for objects focused on performance. As greenrobot claims,

    > **Performance** is the number one reason why we created ObjectBox. Previously,
    > we created greenDAO, the fastest Object/Relational Mapper (ORM) for Android and
    SQLite. Since its first release in 2011, we gained a lot of insight into object
    persistence — and the performance limitations imposed by SQLite. We realized
    that in order to improve performance on mobile significantly, we needed to go to
    the core and build a database designed for objects.

    You can read more about it
    [here](http://greenrobot.org/announcement/introducing-objectbox-beta/). Please
    take into consideration that ObjectBox is currently a beta version (0.9.7).

21. [FlowLayout](https://github.com/nex3z/FlowLayout)  
    This is a library,

    > which allows child views flow to next row when there is not enough space.  
    > The spacing between child views can be calculated by the FlowLayout so that
    the views are evenly placed.

    ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*3uXU95gxWRlrc3Lfh72z3A.png)

    Please note that this is the library still in its early stage.

22. [Unofficial Google Actions Java SDK](https://github.com/frogermcs/Google-Actions-Java-SDK)  
    This is a polish accent from [Mirek Stanek](https://medium.com/@froger_mcs). Because of the fact
    that the official Google Actions SDK is written in Node.js, he introduced his
    unofficial version written natively in Java. According to the *README:*

    > Google Actions Java SDK is built based on official Node.js library, but it’s not
    > a mirror copy of it. The goal is to make it fully compatible with
    [Conversational
    Protocol](https://developers.google.com/actions/reference/conversation) of
    Assistant Platform.

23. [Wearable Reply](https://github.com/klinker24/wearable-reply)  
    On 9th of February 2017 Google released a new [Android Wear 2.0](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/02/AndroidWear2.html).  
    [Luke Klinker](https://twitter.com/lukeklinker) found a missing API and released
    the library for this OS, which

    > allows for quick and easy text input, whether that is from your voice, a
    > keyboard, or canned responses. The missing API is now available!

24. [Shortbread](https://github.com/MatthiasRobbers/shortbread)  
    This is a library that

    > generates [app shortcuts](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/shortcuts.html) for
    > Activities and methods annotated with. No need to touch the manifest, create
    > XML files or use the shortcut manager. Just annotate the code that you want the
    > shortcut to call.

    Currently, it is 1.0.0 version.

25. [Material About](https://github.com/jrvansuita/MaterialAbout)  
    This library helps you to prepare an *About Me* screen to introduce you to your
    users.
