### 12. [kotlin-math](https://github.com/romainguy/kotlin-math)

This is

> Set of Kotlin APIs to make graphics math easier to write. These APIs are mostly
> modeled after GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) to make porting code to and from
shaders easier.

> The various types offered by this library are only meant to be *value types*.
> Most APIs are therefore exposed as top-level functions and not as methods

The project is released under Apache-2.0 license.

### 13. [TicketView](https://github.com/vipulasri/TicketView)

This is a library which provides a Ticket View. It offers 3 types of TicketView
corners: normal, rounded and scallop.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SAKw7FLkt2w3_Io1dH8sgg.png)

library.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*jMxaiYhmgqNOrbUkeSFVcg.png)

How the library works? All the key-values are auto-packaged into a native
library during a compile time. Then it can be obtained from the Java interface
generated by Cipher.so.

The documentation is good enough and the project is released under Apache-2.0
license.

### 15. [android-clean-architecture-mvi-boilerplate](https://github.com/bufferapp/android-clean-architecture-mvi-boilerplate)

boilerplate using the Model-View-Intent pattern.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*sPoW9RyB4DSPFSJkDmNp1g.png)

In the presentation layer it uses now `ViewModels` from the Android Architecture
Components Library. The caching layer now also uses Room.

### 16. [Android-Indefinite-Pager-Indicator](https://github.com/rbro112/Android-Indefinite-Pager-Indicator)

This library is a lightweight, plug-and-play indefinite pager indicator for
`RecyclerViews` & `ViewPagers`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*IyJBQ1rM4Flcj8_P0-75sQ.gif)

This library has really good documentation, sample app, a lot of dots
customisation and is released under MIT license. MinSDK is 16.

### 17. [daggraph](https://github.com/dvdciri/daggraph)

If you use Dagger, you will probably find it interesting to see how your
dependencies look on a graph. Daggerph is a tool which provides this
functionality for you.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*SJeUxkD1Y5SomH2GW5HX9w.png)

The documentation is quite short but enough to get started with the project,
which is released under Apache-2.0 license.

### 18. [ToastCompat](https://github.com/drakeet/ToastCompat)

This is an Android library to hook and fix Toast `BadTokenException`. <br> The
purpose for this library was a fact, that from API 25, a new parameter was added
`IBinder windowToken` for `Toast#handleShow()` and it brought the
`BadTokenException`. This library tries to workaround that issue.

More info you can find in *README* on Github. The project is released under
Apache-2.0 license.

### 19. [RecyclerBanner](https://github.com/renjianan/RecyclerBanner)

This is not a library but a sample app which shows how to create a carousel
using `RecyclerView`.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*z03XaCe1VJiFg5bkS5QryQ.gif)

Unfortunately there is no English documentation, however you can refer to [this
article](https://juejin.im/post/5a13a28c51882512a860ee6a) (tutorial) and
translate it.

### 20. [FancyToast-Android](https://github.com/Shashank02051997/FancyToast-Android)

This library makes native Android Toasts Fancy. It takes the standard Android
Toast to the next level with a variety of styling options. It offers also
styling Toasts from the code.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*xRGylM8wqFjq7IUxJOJbcQ.png)

This library has a good documentation and contains a sample app as well. MinSDK
is set to 19 and this whole project is released under Apache-2.0 license.

### 21.
[RecyclerViewCardGallery](https://github.com/zjw-swun/RecyclerViewCardGallery)

This library is a fork from this
[RecyclerViewCardGallery](https://github.com/huazhiyuan2008/RecyclerViewCardGallery).
Instead of using ViewPager, an author used RecyclerView, to achieve carousel
effect with swipe to refresh.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YKGJDd-cQ0S1thF7lwahcg.gif)

The project has basic documentation, sample app and it is released under
Apache-2.0 license.

### 22. [ig-lazy-module-loader](https://github.com/Instagram/ig-lazy-module-loader)

> This library helps with loading modules (features) in Android apps on demand,
> whenever needed. Before this library can be used a module needs to be compiled
to a separate jar/dex or apk file.

> Right now, the library supports java libraries and android libraries which don’t
> rely on android resources.

The author of the library also mentioned the benefits of Lazy loading of a
feature vs having the feature in the main executable file:

* feature is loaded in memory only when really needed. It offloads code from the
main executable file which remains smaller which guarantees better cold start
time. On Dalvik it offloads methods off the main dex file decreasing performance
penalty of multi dex
* feature code is clustered together in memory as it lives in one file and it
provides most optimal execution in terms of memory access
* less disk space is used if some features remain unused because code is not
uncompressed
* it may improve developer velocity where many developers concurrently work on the
same codebase by providing very rigid isolation between features
* module hotswapping may be implemented allowing for faster development without
restarting the app

### 23. [retrofit2-kotlin-coroutines-adapter](https://github.com/JakeWharton/retrofit2-kotlin-coroutines-adapter)

This is an experimental Retrofit 2 `CallAdapter.Factory` for [Kotlin
coroutine's](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html) `Deferred`.
Released under Apache-2.0 license.

### 24. [CalendarPicker](https://github.com/maxyou/CalendarPicker)

This library is another calendar and date picker. It can preset a selected date
and is heavily customisable — you can customise almost all text sizes and
colours, background colours and month title.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nyZyTj3ouTs_ZpK3Q2mXIA.gif)

This library is released under MIT license and has basic documentation.

### 25. [avocado](https://github.com/alexjlockwood/avocado)

This is a command line tool (similar to `svgo`) that optimizes Android
`VectorDrawable` (VD) and `AnimatedVectorDrawable` (AVD) xml files. <br> It is
created by [Alex Lockwood](https://medium.com/@alexjlockwood) and released under
MIT license.

What it exactly does:

> `avdo` rewrites the `VectorDrawable` using the smallest number of `<group>`s and
> `<path>`s possible, reducing their file sizes and making them faster to parse
and draw at runtime. The example below shows the contents of a `VectorDrawable`
before and after being run through `avdo`

That’s it. I hope you enjoyed my list. If you know any other great library,
which was released in past 3 months and I didn’t mention about it, please let
me know in the comments.
