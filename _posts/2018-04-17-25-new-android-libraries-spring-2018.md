Let’s get off to a good start with scrcpy! This tool is developed by
[Genymotion](https://medium.com/u/1cfe8b93fd49) team and does exactly the same
what [Vysor](https://www.vysor.io/) does (if you’re not familiar with this tool,
you can check my article about [10 useful tools for Android
Developers](https://hackernoon.com/10-tools-which-will-boost-your-android-productivity-and-hype-bea88e0bcd86)).   
It provides display and control of Android devices connected on USB. It does not
require any *root* access. It works on *GNU/Linux*, *Windows* and *MacOS *and it
is for free.
