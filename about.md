Hey!

My name is Michal Bialas. I am  **Android Engineer** and **Professional Scrum Master** with a passion for software engineering, agile methodologies, Android development and all great libraries and frameworks.

I am really enthusiastic about making things cleverer, simpler and smarter. I believe in Albert Einstein's quotation: *Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler*.

Whenever I have a moment, I absorb the novelties of the world of modern mobile technology and try to craft something myself or facilitate other's work.

I am also passionate about UX/UI patterns for mobile and I treat it as a hobby and time for relaxation from casual duties.

I hope you will enjoy reading this blog.
